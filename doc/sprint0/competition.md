## Competitor Companies
Since our platform is for job seekers and recruiters, our main competitors are other job seeking and recruiting platforms such as:
- LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com)
- Glassdoor (www.glassdoor.ca)
- Workday (www.workday.com)

## What We Offer
As compared to our competitors, our platform will allow job seekers and recruiters to complete the entire job seeking and hiring process all from this platform. This includes applying to jobs, reaching out to candidates, and even conducting interviews all on this platform. Our competitors offer similar services, but often have to be used in conjunction with other platforms. For example, applicants can apply to jobs on LinkedIn, but there is no interview feature. Compared to Workday where you need to create a new account for every company you apply to, our platform will only require creating 1 account that can be used to apply to any company.

Our users are divided into 2 categories:

- Job Seekers
For job seekers, our platform is better because it focuses on allowing them to apply to jobs in a fast manner, as well as getting important information about the companies without having to pay any money. This is perfect for job seekers who are currently unemployed or working for an underpaying job and are on a tight budget and are constantly working overtime with limited time for job hunting. Our competitors such as LinkedIn have a subscription based business model where users need to pay to access insights about a company, but since LinkedIn is a for profit company, they cannot afford to have a completely free platform like our platform.

- Recruiters 
For recruiters, our platform will make it easier for them to find and keep track of candidates and also set up and conduct video interviews with the candidate. This is good for recruiters, because oftentimes they are overwhelmed by the number of different platforms (usually paid platforms) they have to manage and use to find candidates and conduct interviews with them. Our product allows them to do everything from just 1 place. In a scenario where the recruiter must find a new candidate immediately to fill a role, this platform can help by allowing the recruiter to search for candidates with specific skill sets and schedule an interview and notify the applicant without needing to spend time using a second app to set up an interview and notify the candidate using a third app. Competitors may not have focused on the interview feature because it is difficult to scale video conferencing in a cost effective manner.

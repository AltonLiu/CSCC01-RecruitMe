We use the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
- the ```master``` branch is for the latest stable production release.
- the ```develop``` branch contains the stable features for the next release.
- the ```feature``` branches are for developing new features. Should be in the form ```feature/"feature name"```.
- the ```release``` branch is for bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks.
- the ```hotfix``` branches are for patching production releases. Should be in the form ```hotfix/"hotfixed feature"```.

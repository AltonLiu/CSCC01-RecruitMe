## Project Objective:
To build a web application that assists in job searching. For job seekers, this app helps them apply to jobs, conduct research on companies, and receive interviews. For the recruiters, the app allows them to look for candidates, post jobs, conduct interviews, and network with other users on the platform.

## The Key Personas:
- Linda Jones is a 30 year old recruiter from Amazon who likes to efficient with her time and uses produces that streamline her day to day activities. She primarily reaches out to candidates for technology and engineering roles.
- John Smith is a recent graduate who majored in Computer Science from the University of Toronto that is seeking for jobs but lacks knowledge of their industry and the application process.

## The Key Usage Scenarios:
- John Smith is looking for a job that can make use of his degree but does not know how to start and is unaware of the appropriate salary range for new graduates. To help himself find a job, John creates a profile on this platform and starts looking for jobs as well as learns about various tech companies by viewing descriptions and comments on the companies profile page.
- Linda is looking to hire a senior software engineer who can fill the role of an employee that left the company on short notice. Linda can use our platform to filter through different candidates based on their skills and can easily send an interview notification to potential candidates with the click of a button and video chat with them on this platform.

## The Key Principles:
This platform should prioritise ease of use for job seekers and recruiters over anything else. The job seekers should be able to easily apply to jobs and spend less than 5 minutes per application as well as be able to find companies that they are interested in. Recruiters should be able to easily identify suitable candidates and set up and conduct interviews with them on this platform alone.

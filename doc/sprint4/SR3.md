Unfinished tasks and group them into stories; add them to SR4.md in the form of new user stories. Update your PB.md and save the updated copy in doc/sprint4 (yes, sprint4 - prepare for the next sprint!) 

What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
Doing demos during standups was a good practice, because it allowed us to find bugs earlier

What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint
Reset the burndown chart counter when the sprint starts so the burndown chart doesnâ€™t generate incorrectly

What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
We should finish our work earlier so we have more time to test and fix issues

What was your best/worst experience during sprint 3
Best: backend being finished early made frontend development and integration easier
Worst: the trello burndown chart not working properly

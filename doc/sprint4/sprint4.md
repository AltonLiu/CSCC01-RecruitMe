**Sprint 3 Planning Meeting:**

On our first stand up meeting for sprint 4 on Nov. 7, 2022, all members were present to choose the next 5 user stories to work on and reflect on sprint 3. We divided the stories into smaller tasks which were split into frontend and backend. Each member then chose the task they were most comfortable with.

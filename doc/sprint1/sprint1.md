# Sprint 1 Planning Meeting

On our first stand up meeting for sprint 1 on September 28, 2022, all members were present to choose 5 user stories to work on. We divided the stories into smaller tasks which were split into frontend and backend. Each member then chose the task they were most comfortable with.

## Goal

The goal for the sprint was to build the core functionalities of the app, so we prioritized stories that allowed users to register and log in as well as create their profile. Afterwards, we estimated the amount of work required for each story, including their subtasks, in terms of hours of work required to complete it.
